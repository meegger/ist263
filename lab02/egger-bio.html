    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
        Throughout my young life I was a competitive dancer, so I am passionate about the arts, however I also love hiking and skiing in the Pacific Northwest and reading psychological thrillers and crime biographies. Currently Iâ€™m reading My Friend Anna, written by the ex-best friend of a young con-artist to tell her experience of being scammed. At home, I have no siblings, however many close cousins, and a cat named Phenom that we took in as a stray, and one of her favorite things to do is climb over any laptop and notebook that she sees.
