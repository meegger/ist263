                <p>My great great grandpa Frank used to say, “If you treat your customers like family, you are unbeatable,” and we keep that at the forefront of our business to this day. Our customer experience goes beyond being respected, listened to, and valued. We, and all those involved with the dealership, want to make each and every customer of ours feel like they have walked into a Brotherton family household. This is why our customer service is modeled after the values we hold so highly in our family legacy.</p>

                <p><em>Love.</em> Quite simply put, the Brotherton family is taught from being a baby that love should come above all else in your life. No matter the external influences in your life or how tough of a day it has been, you will set that aside to show your family members you love them and help them when needed. Though Brotherton Cadillac is extremely important to each of us in the family, it is more important that we show one another how much we love each other. When I was a toddler and my mom was in law school, my Grandpa Biff would clear his schedule every Friday to take care of me so that my mom could attend classes. Each one of my cousins and I had a mini desk or art area in the dealership offices so that we could spend time with our family while being entertained. This idea of doing whatever it takes for those you love and not letting a day go by where your family doesn’t know how much you love them is what we bring into the dealership. We want each and every customer who walks in our doors to know that we value them highly, care about their well-being, and want to get to know them as a human being, not just a possible supporter of our business.</p>

                <p><em>Honesty.</em> In the Brotherton family, we are taught to say what you feel and mean, even if it may be difficult to hear, because honesty is much better in the long run. We take the time to have tough conversations with one another, whether over the phone or at a family dinner, to show that we want the best for one another and value each other highly enough to be honest. Each of us learn more and grow better as a person with honesty as a top priority in our lives. For customers, this means that we want to communicate as honestly and transparently as possible. There will not be the hiding of specific information pieces in your buying process or white lies to “make you feel better.” We want the same sense of openness in our dealership that we use at home with one another. It not only makes it easier on us but provides you with a more comfortable experience when you walk through the Brotherton doors. No games will be played nor will you have to watch out for a slick talker. We will give you the truth, just as we would want you to respond to us with.</p>

                <p><em>Dedication.</em> If there is one thing I feel that I could give my family an award for it would be fostering an environment and expectation of hard work. Not a single one of us as children were allowed to give up on something difficult or walk away from something we started. We each had to show our dedication to whatever it was by sticking around long enough to finish what we began. This goes deeper than an art project or childhood activity, though. This is simply seen in the legacy of Brotherton Cadillac. Each and every member of the Brotherton family has made a choice to stick by our business through good and bad and understand it is a forever part of our lives, especially Frank, Tex, Biff, and Brad, who have taken full responsibility for the dealership no matter what. As consumers, we are dedicated to you having the best experience you ever had in a vehicle dealership. Beyond water bottles and cookies when you wait in our lobby, we give you kindness and open ears to foster communication on the sales floor. Whether it’s a late-night car delivery to another area in the state or finding you the vehicle perfectly fit to your wants and needs, we are all dedicated to giving you the Brotherton experience. </p>
