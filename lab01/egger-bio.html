    <body>
    I am an Accounting and Retail Management major at Syracuse University with a minor in Information Management & Technology. I am interested in earning my CPA license to work in public accounting before transitioning into the financial side of retail merchandising. Here on campus, I am President of TAMID Group, an organization that provides hands-on consulting and fund experience to college students, and Treasurer of my sorority, managing the financial aspects and budgeting of the chapter. This upcoming summer I will be interning with a regional accounting firm in New York City, which has been a dream of mine for many years coming from the west coast. Throughout my young life I was a competitive dancer, so I am passionate about the arts, however I also love hiking and skiing in the Pacific Northwest and reading psychological thrillers and crime biographies. Currently Iâ€™m reading My Friend Anna, written by the ex-best friend of a young con-artist to tell her experience of being scammed. At home, I have no siblings, however many close cousins, and a cat named Phenom that we took in as a stray, and one of her favorite things to do is climb over any laptop and notebook that she sees.
